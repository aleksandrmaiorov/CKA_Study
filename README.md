# CKA_Study

I plan to take my CKA certification exam at the end of June. I will study at least 2 hours/day. 
By the end of the June I will be CKA Certified consultant.


# June 20th.
Today I found out that I passed my CKA exam. Next one is CKAD and CKS, but I will wait till Black Friday to get big discount.
